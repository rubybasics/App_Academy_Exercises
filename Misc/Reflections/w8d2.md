<span id="tuesday"><em>Tuesday 5 Novembmer 2013&mdash;</em></span> Yesterday was our last pair-programming project; I worked with *Ben Watts* on a little chat server in Node using WebSockets. I felt like perhaps there was something regrettable about shoving so much functionality into a big callback, but maybe that's just the nature of JavaScript, and not really regrettable at all? On Sunday I started my RSS-aggregator capstone project, now called Superscription.
