Yesterday I worked with *Tommy Nast* on a crude [*Asteroids*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) clone using HTML canvas, and today I worked with *Irene Zhou* on a [towers of Hanoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) UI and started a [Snake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)) game using jQuery and DOM manipulation. I'm sleeping over at the office tonight, having spent the evening working on Wires.
