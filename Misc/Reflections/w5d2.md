I got all the specs to pass on the assessment with time to spare. Today's designated project was *Friend Circle* (!), a Google+ish thing where users can put other users in circles and share posts with them. I was scheduled to pair with *Jeff Rosen*, but apparently he was ill, and so I worked alone after lunch. The instructions described a somewhat ambitious project; I actually only got as far as letting users create circles and will have to catch up later. Associations are actually really powerful! Still no BART settlement ... and no strike, either; I decided to come home tonight, the allure of a shower and bed and privacy outweighing the travel uncertainty. Tomorrow we're going to make a very simple clone of some of the functionality of Rails itself (following up on our [earlier](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/10/app-academy-diary-week-four/#monday) very simple clone of some of the functionality of ActiveRecord). I guess I'll call it ... Ruby on Wires?
