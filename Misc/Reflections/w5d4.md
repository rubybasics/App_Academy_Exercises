Writing Ruby on Wires yesterday (albeit building off the supplied skeleton) was really fun; I hooked it up to SedentaryRecord and started a blog engine ("blog engine"&mdash;well, okay, so you fill out a form and it adds your content to a page) that actually works, without Rails! Today I worked with Ben Hass [again](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/09/app-academy-diary-week-one/#friday) on a Reddit-like thing with RSpec tests (and FactoryGirl and Faker to construct test objects). Near the end, under Ben's leadership, we used JavaScript and jQuery to get comment forms to appear on the page in response to a user clicking "Reply", but didn't have time to actually get the comment submission to work. The trains are really going away tomorrow; perhaps I'll be able to join an *ad hoc* carpool at the station?
